I am a undergraduate student at the University of Michigan studying computer science and mathematics. Most of my work is related to my research in deep reinforcement learning. I am also quite active in competetive programming (mostly on Codeforces). I occasionally work on solo projects as well. My collaborative work is in private repos.
